# Utilities
In this repository you can find some useful scripts that at least once helped me. 

## Cross Stitch
If you know someone who likes Cross Stitching you can send him/her some schematics created with this script. You have only to select the picture, select the numbers of colors you want and the point dimension.

## Secret Santa
Do you want to create Secret Santa combinations? Just put inside the names you want and everyone will be paired with someone else. You'll have some nice txt files with the designed gift-receiver.

## zip_archives_auto_creation
A simple script for putting many files in some zip folders with a maximum designed size.

## check_pics_folder1_vs_folder2
A simple script for checking if pictures inside a folder (with subfolders) are already present in a second folder (target). This helped me to understand if I already moved old photos to my hard disk before copying and paste the same pictures twice.
